#ut our notes here about how we want to attack

#possible languages
- ruby
- go

Tampering: A really big file with a small tamper(modification) like altering one bit at the end of a file

- inject unicode
- negative numbers
- integer overflow
- signed/vs/unsigned
- multi-tag (E and G) not one or the other
- offtag readlog -U with -S

Performance: a really big file to batch / read

Correctness: Must be tested in batch and single mode  | type

Add line after each "should fail" case that is legit to ensure
that the log is working appropriately. While this happens as the
test cases run in general I have added a line where it is person
specific. // IDEA SCRAPPED IN THE INTEREST OF AUTOMATION
