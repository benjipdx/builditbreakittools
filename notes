Tampering: A really big file with a small tamper(modification) like altering one bit at the end of a file

- inject unicode
- negative numbers
- integer overflow
- signed/vs/unsigned
- multi-tag (E and G) not one or the other
- offtag readlog -U with -S

Performance: a really big file to batch / read

About the different willfail files: Each file is the same as
every other file in the sense that they all check for the same
thing and in the same order. However, from file to file the
order of the flags differs.
