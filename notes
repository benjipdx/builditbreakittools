#ut our notes here about how we want to attack

#possible languages
- ruby
- go

#from whiteboard

Tampering: A really big file with a small tamper(modification) like altering one bit at the end of a file

- inject unicode
- negative numbers
- integer overflow
- signed/vs/unsigned
- multi-tag (E and G) not one or the other
- offtag readlog -U with -S

Performance: a really big file to batch / read
